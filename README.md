This repository documents my attempts to create a service for ECLC which logs the amount of Narcan disseminated to the community of Okaloosa County and the subsequent result on the community. 
I still havent decided whether or not this should be a website or a standalone mobile app. 
The goal began simply as an easy way to log our numbers but as development has continued there have been several new ideas I've found worth implementing. The more ideas I have, the more the likelihood of this becoming an app increases. 
The main issue keeping me from making this an app has to do with accessibility. Our original concept was for this to be accessibile via QR code located on our various bins placed throughout Okaloosa County which contained Narcan. Previously, we'd rely Narcan use numbers texted to us by the people we handed them out too. This method is inherently unreliable due to the human factor, and our logging efforts proved to be increasingly time consuming. This project only lightens our load in regards to logging but issue of initial reporting remains. As it stands, there is no forseeable solution
