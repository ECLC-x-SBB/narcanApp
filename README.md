__*** The current LIVE branch is "Without Auth0". Ideally, I'd like to go live with Auth0 and allow users to create and maintain accounts. However, I've been having a rough go at it. I will continue my efforts towards making it a reality; however, there are more pressing issues to focus on before I can return to that task. We will be ready to go live as soon as I finish the Community Resources page. Once we are live, I will return to my attempt at making Auth0 a reality. Until then, consider the main branch to be in Alpha. ***__

This repository documents my attempts to create a service for Emerald Coast Life Center(ECLC) that logs the amount of Narcan disseminated to the Okaloosa County community and the subsequent results on the community. 

I've yet to decide whether or not this should be a website, a standalone mobile app, or both. 

The project began simply as an easy way to log our numbers, but as development has continued, I've found several new ideas worth implementing. The more ideas I have, the more likely this becomes an app. 

The main issue keeping me from making this an app is accessibility. Our original concept was for this to be accessible via a QR code on our bins containing Narcan placed throughout Okaloosa County. 

Currently, we base our Narcan use numbers on text messages sent by the people we hand out Narcan to. This method is inherently unreliable due to the human factor, and our logging efforts proved to be increasingly time-consuming with the more Narcan we hand out. This project only lightens our workload regarding logging, but the issue of initial reporting remains. 

As it stands, there is no foreseeable solution regarding the reliability of reporting. This is especially tricky because the bulk of the Narcan we hand out is subsequently dispersed to others who may hand it out to others. This doesn't even consider the fact that the majority of the people we are relying on for reports are individuals in active drug addiction, which increases the volatility of potential reports.
