__*** The current LIVE branch is "main". Ideally, I'd like to go live with Auth0 and enable users to create and manage their accounts. However, I've been having a tough time with it. I will continue my efforts towards making it a reality; however, there are more pressing issues to focus on before I can return to that task. We will be ready to go live as soon as I finish the Community Resources page. Once we are live, I will resume my attempt to make Auth0 a reality. Until then, consider the "Auth0" branch to be in Alpha. ***__

This repository documents my attempts to create a service for Emerald Coast Life Center (ECLC) that logs the amount of Narcan distributed to the Okaloosa County community and the subsequent impact on the community. 

I've yet to decide whether or not this should be a website, a standalone mobile app, or both. 

The project began simply as a way to log our numbers, but as development continued, I've found several new ideas worth implementing. The more ideas I have, the more likely it becomes that this will be an app. 

The primary issue preventing me from developing this as an app is accessibility. Our original concept was for this to be accessible via a QR code on our bins, which contain Narcan, placed throughout Okaloosa County. 

Currently, we base our Narcan use numbers on the text messages sent by the individuals to whom we distribute Narcan. This method is inherently unreliable due to the human factor, and our logging efforts have proven to be increasingly time-consuming as we distribute more Narcan. This project only lightens our workload regarding logging, but the issue of initial reporting remains. 

As it stands, there is no foreseeable solution to the issue of reporting reliability. This is especially challenging because the bulk of the Narcan we distribute is subsequently given to others, who may then distribute it to others. This doesn't even consider the fact that the majority of the people we are relying on for reports are individuals in active drug addiction, which increases the volatility of potential reports.
